    <div>
        <p>Trevor Noah's book, "Born a Crime," talks about his life growing up in South Africa. </p>
           <p>It touches on themes of race, identity, and growing up in a society that is deeply divided by racial lines and also challenges faced by mixed-race in a society</p> 
           <p> In the first chapter, Noah introduces his mother Patricia, a brave woman who married a white man named Trevor, defying</p>
           <p>social norms in the early 1980s. This was a significant event in South Africa, where interracial marriages were not</p>
           <p>common and often met with hostility. This decision by Patricia sets the stage for the challenges that Trevor would face as a </p>
           <p> mixed-race child in a society that is deeply segregated by race.</p>
           <p>The second chapter takes a closer look at how Patricia's Noah marriage affected the family's life, including social isolation,</p>
           <p>financial difficulties, and the constant threat of violence. It also introduces Abel, a recurring figure in Noah's life who </p>
           <p>represents the racial tensions and violence that pervade South African society. Abel's actions, including shooting Patricia,</p>
           <p>serve as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by mixed-race individuals in a society that is deeply divided by race.</p>
           <p> These two chapters show how parents support their children in the face of adversity and are willing to take risks to protect</p>
           <p>them from harm. They also highlight the importance of teaching children discipline and faith, even in difficult circumstances.</p>
