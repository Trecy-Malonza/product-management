        <p>Trevor Noah's book, "Born a Crime," talks about his life growing up in South Africa. 
           It touches on themes of race, identity, and growing up in a society that is deeply divided by racial
           lines and also challenges faced by mixed-race in a society.</p> 
           
        <p>In the first chapter, Noah introduces his mother Patricia, a brave woman who married a white man named Trevor, defying
           social norms in the early 1980s. This was a significant event in South Africa, where interracial marriages were not
           common and often met with hostility. 
           This decision by Patricia sets the stage for the challenges that Trevor would face as a mixed-race child in a society that is deeply segregated by race. </p>


    <p> The second chapter takes a closer look at how Patricia's Noah marriage affected the family's life, including social isolation,
           financial difficulties, and the constant threat of violence. It also introduces Abel, a recurring figure in Noah's life who
           represents the racial tensions and violence that pervade South African society. </p> 

        <p>Abel's actions, including shooting Patricia,serve as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by mixed-race individuals in a society that is deeply divided by race.
            These two chapters show how parents support their children in the face of adversity and are willing to take risks to protect
           them from harm. They also highlight the importance of teaching children discipline and faith, even in difficult circumstances.</p>
